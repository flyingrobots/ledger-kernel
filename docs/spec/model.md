# State‑Transition Model

This page mirrors the formal model from MODEL.md. The canonical source lives at the repository root; the docs build syncs it into this section.

<div class="vp-doc">

<!-- Synced content begins -->

{% raw %}
<!-- Placeholder: synced content from MODEL.md goes here via scripts/sync_docs.sh in future commit. -->
{% endraw %}

> Temporary note: see the top‑level MODEL.md for the full text until the sync is wired to this path.
